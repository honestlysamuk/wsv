//! A Moore machine is another form of state machine which is defined by six other variables.
//!
//! The Moore variation is characterised by having "Moore" states than the Mealy one. Enjoyably, this distinction is not so obvious when comparing the code in Rust, since we have the option to use the _ as a match against "the rest".
//! The input set is still this number plus one for the None case.

/*
An identifying feature of a state machine is the number of states used in the computation. It looks at first glance that this one only has 18 states, but enums are sum types. This means that the size (cardinality) of the enum is actually the sum of cardinalities of each variant. `State::Comment` is a unit variant and so has a cardinality of 1. Error has a cardinality equal to the cardinality of `ErrorKind`, which is 2. `StringPart` and `Value` have a cardinality equal to `char`. Since `char` can be any valid unicode symbol and there are 149,813 of those as of [Unicode 15.1.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.1.0/), the total number of states is

> (18 - 3) + 2 + 149,813 + 149,813
> = 299,643
